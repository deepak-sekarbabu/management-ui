## Development Workflow

### Adding New Components
When adding new React components, please adhere to the following:
> *   **Location:**
>     *   Shared, reusable components go into `src/components/`.
>     *   Components specific to a particular page or feature section should reside within a sub-folder in `src/sections/` (e.g., `src/sections/user/ProfileSpecificComponent.jsx`).
>     *   Page-level components are typically in `src/pages/`.
> *   **Naming:** Use PascalCase for component file names and named exports (e.g., `MyComponent.jsx`).
> *   **Styling:** Detail the project's preferred styling approach (e.g., "Use Emotion for styling, collocated with the component or in a `styles.js` file"). *(Maintainer: Please specify the exact styling convention)*
> *   **Exports:** Use named exports rather than default exports for components.
> *   **Index Files:** Consider using `index.js` or `index.ts` files in component folders for easier importing (`import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';` instead of `import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent/MyComponent';`).
### Testing Strategy
This project uses **Jest** for running tests and **React Testing Library (RTL)** for testing React components.
> *   **Philosophy:** Focus on testing component behavior from a user's perspective. Avoid testing implementation details.
> *   **Location:** Test files should be collocated with the code they are testing, typically in a `__tests__` subfolder or with a `.test.js` or `.spec.js` extension (e.g., `MyComponent.test.jsx`). *(Maintainer: Please specify the exact test file location/naming convention)*
> *   **Running Tests:**
>     *   `yarn test` or `npm run test`: Runs all tests.
>     *   `yarn test:watch` or `npm run test:watch`: Runs tests in watch mode, re-running on changes.
>     *   `yarn test:coverage` or `npm run test:coverage`: Runs tests and generates a coverage report.
> *   **Coverage:** Aim for a reasonable level of test coverage for new components and logic.
### Linting and Formatting
We use **ESLint** for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript and **Prettier** for code formatting to ensure a consistent code style.
> *   **Configuration:** Rules are defined in `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` respectively.
> *   **Execution:**
>     *   `yarn lint` or `npm run lint`: Manually run ESLint.
>     *   `yarn lint:fix` or `npm run lint:fix`: Manually run ESLint and attempt to fix issues.
>     *   `yarn prettier` or `npm run prettier`: Manually format code with Prettier.
> *   **Automation (Husky):** This project uses Husky for Git hooks. Linting and formatting checks are likely configured to run automatically before commits (e.g., as a pre-commit hook). This helps maintain code quality and consistency. *(Maintainer: Please confirm and detail if Husky pre-commit hooks are set up for linting/formatting)*

## Architecture Overview
This section provides insights into key architectural decisions and patterns used in this project.

### State Management: Redux Toolkit
This application uses **Redux Toolkit** for managing global application state.
> *   **Role:** Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux development with utilities for creating slices of state, managing asynchronous actions (e.g., with `createAsyncThunk`), and configuring the Redux store.
> *   **Key Concepts:**
>     *   **Slices:** A collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature in your app (e.g., `userSlice`, `productSlice`). These are typically found in `src/store/slices/` or co-located with features under `src/sections/feature/featureSlice.js`. *(Maintainer: Please specify where slices are located, e.g., `src/store/slices/` or co-located like `src/sections/user/userSlice.js`)*
>     *   **Store:** The Redux store is configured in `src/store/store.js` (or a similar path), bringing together all the different slices. *(Maintainer: Please specify store location, e.g., `src/store.js` or `src/app/store.js`)*
>     *   **Selectors:** Used to read data from the store in your components.
>     *   **Dispatching Actions:** Components dispatch actions to update the store.
> *   **When to use:** Use Redux for state that needs to be shared across many components, or when component state becomes too complex to manage locally with `useState` or `useReducer`.
### Key Dependencies (Beyond Core React/MUI)
While the "Tech Stack" section lists all major technologies, here's a bit more on *why* some key external libraries are used:
> *   **ApexCharts:** Chosen for its rich, interactive charting capabilities to visualize data effectively.
> *   **Axios:** A popular, promise-based HTTP client for making requests to backend APIs. It provides a robust and easy-to-use interface for network communication.
> *   **date-fns & dayjs:** These libraries offer powerful and flexible solutions for parsing, formatting, manipulating, and displaying dates and times, which are often needed in management UIs.
> *   **React Router v6:** Handles client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views/pages within this single-page application (SPA).
> *   **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, helping to catch errors early during development and improving code quality and maintainability.

## Deployment
This section outlines general guidance for deploying this React application.

### Building for Production
First, you need to create a production-ready build of the application. This typically involves optimizations like minification, code splitting, and tree shaking.
> ```bash
> yarn build
> # or
> npm run build
> ```
> This command will usually generate a `dist/` or `build/` folder containing the static assets for your application. *(Maintainer: Please verify the output folder, e.g., `dist/`)*

### Static Hosting Platforms
Since this is a client-side React application, it can be deployed to any platform that supports static site hosting. Popular choices include:
> *   **Netlify:** Offers a simple drag-and-drop deployment, Git integration, CI/CD, and a generous free tier.
> *   **Vercel:** From the creators of Next.js, Vercel provides excellent support for deploying React applications, with features like Git integration, serverless functions, and global CDN.
> *   **AWS S3 & CloudFront:** For more control, you can host your static files on AWS S3 and serve them via AWS CloudFront for global distribution and SSL.
> *   **Firebase Hosting:** Provides fast and secure hosting for your web app with easy setup and a global CDN.
> *   **GitHub Pages:** A good option for project sites, directly from your GitHub repository. May require additional configuration for client-side routing (e.g., using a custom 404 page or a specific router strategy).


### General Steps for Deployment (Example with Netlify/Vercel):
1.  **Push your code** to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
> 2.  **Connect your Git repository** to the hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
> 3.  **Configure build settings:**
>     *   **Build command:** `yarn build` or `npm run build`
>     *   **Publish directory:** `dist` (or your project's build output directory)
> 4.  **Set up environment variables** on the hosting platform, similar to your local `.env` file (especially `VITE_API_BASE_URL` and any other runtime variables).
> 5.  **Deploy!**
>


## Backend Integration
This React application interacts with backend services to fetch and persist data.

### API Endpoints
The primary backend API URL is configured via the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable. Other specific paths for services like authentication are also defined in the environment variables (e.g., `VITE_API_AUTH_PATH`, `VITE_API_LOGIN_PATH`).
>
> Refer to the "Environment Variables" section for a complete list of API-related configuration.


### Data Fetching
**Axios** is used as the HTTP client for making API requests (see "Key Dependencies" in the "Architecture Overview"). You'll typically find API service calls abstracted into functions, possibly within `src/services/` or co-located with features that consume them. *(Maintainer: Please specify where API service call functions are primarily located, e.g., `src/services/api.js` or within feature sections like `src/sections/user/userService.js`.)*

### Authentication
The application handles authentication by [describe the general authentication flow, e.g., "sending credentials to the backend via an API call, receiving a JWT token, and storing this token for subsequent authenticated requests."]. The specific authentication routes are configured via environment variables.
*(Maintainer: Please provide a brief overview of the authentication flow if it's more specific than the example.)*

### CORS
When developing locally, you might encounter Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues if the backend API is served from a different domain or port. Ensure the backend API is configured to allow requests from your local development origin (usually `http://localhost:xxxx`), or use Vite's proxy feature if needed. *(Maintainer: If Vite's proxy is configured or recommended, add details here.)*

---

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

Encountering issues during setup? Here are a few common things to check:
*   **Node.js Version:** Ensure your Node.js version meets the requirements stated in the "Prerequisites" section. You can use a tool like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to manage multiple Node.js versions.
*   **Dependencies:** If you face issues after `yarn install` or `npm install`, try removing your `node_modules` folder and `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file, then run the install command again.
*   **Environment Variables:** Double-check that your `.env` file is correctly set up and contains all the necessary variables as described in the "Environment Variables" section.
*   **Port Conflicts:** If the application fails to start, another service might be using the required port. Check for port conflicts and stop the conflicting service or change the port for this application (if configurable).
*   **Browser Cache:** For front-end issues, sometimes a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) or clearing browser cache can help.
*   *[Placeholder for project-specific gotchas, e.g., "If you see error X, it might be due to Y..."]*
